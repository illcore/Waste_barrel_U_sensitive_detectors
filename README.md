# Muon tomography - Sensitive detectors - Solid nuclear waste drum in GEANT4
* Muon tracking via sensitive detectors at top and bottom hodoscopes;
* Four sensitive detectors are defined, i.e. at second top, third top, first bottom, and second bottom plastic scintillators;
* One is suppsoed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
